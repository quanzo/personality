## Backend response format <a name="server-format"></a>

This Tool works with uploading files from the device

**Scenario:**

1. User select file from the device
2. Tool sends it to **your** backend (on `config.endpoint.byFile` route)
3. Your backend should save file and return file data with JSON at specified format.
4. Personality tool shows saved image and stores server answer

So, you can implement backend for file saving by your own way. It is a specific and trivial task depending on your
environment and stack.

Response of your uploader **should** cover following format:

```json5
{
    "success" : 1,
    "file": {
        "url" : "https://capella.pics/3c0e1b97-bc56-4961-b54e-2a6c2c3260f2.jpg"
    }
}
```

**success** - uploading status. 1 for successful, 0 for failed

**file** - uploaded file data. **Must** contain an `url` field with full public path to the uploaded image.
